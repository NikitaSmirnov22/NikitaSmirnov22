### Hi there, I`m Nikita 👾 🦄

### I`m a data scientist with a keen interest in AI and Machine Learning.

- I`m currently finishing up my final project at an [awesome coding bootcamp](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en) in Berlin, Germany📍
- Now, I`m primarily focusing on the idea of the final project related to the implementation of the various Artificial Neural Network algorithms used for solving [object detection tasks](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/object-detection-with-deep-learning-on-aerial-imagery-2465078db8a9)🕵🏻‍♂️🛣
- My current goal #1 - looking for working opportunities and collaboration within fintech companies interested in the Junior Data Science specialists ✨🌈

@Ask me about - finding a great place to visit in Berlin 🙌🏽🔝
