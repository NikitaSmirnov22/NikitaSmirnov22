### Hi there, I`m Nikita 👾

### I`m a Junior Data Scientist with a keen interest in AI and Machine Learning.

- I`m currently finishing up my final project at an [awesome coding bootcamp](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en) in Berlin, Germany📍
- Now, I`m primarily focusing on the idea of the final project related to the implementation of the various Artificial Neural Network algorithms used for solving [object detection tasks](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/object-detection-with-deep-learning-on-aerial-imagery-2465078db8a9)🕵🏻‍♂️🛣
- Ask me about - finding a great place to visit in Berlin 🙌🏽🔝
- My current goal - looking for working opportunities and collaboration within the field of Data Science✨🌈

### Feel_free_to_reach_out)
